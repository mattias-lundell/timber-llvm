=======================================
Welcome to the Timber compiler sources!
=======================================


Requirements
============

To compile the Timber compiler, you'll need

   ghc (haskell.org/ghc)
   gcc (gcc.gnu.org)

Furthermore, to compile the grammar (Parser.y into Parser.hs) you'll need

   happy (haskell.org/happy)

Version numbers known to work are ghc 6.10.1, happy 1.17, and gcc 4.0.


Installing
=============

If you have the cabal-install package installed, the following works:

   cabal install timberc

If you would rather do a manual installation of the compiler in the default 
location (you may need root privileges for this), use the following commands:

   runhaskell Setup.lhs configure
   runhaskell Setup.lhs build
   runhaskell Setup.lhs install

You can select another location for the installation of the compiler by 
using the following commands:

   runhaskell Setup.lhs configure --user --prefix=<the install path>
   runhaskell Setup.lhs build
   runhaskell Setup.lhs install

You can also give other options to the installation script, see

   runhaskell Setup.lhs configure --help.


Running
=======

For info on how to run the compiler once installed, type

   timberc --help
