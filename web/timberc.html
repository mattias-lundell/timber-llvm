<h3>Timber compiler</h3>
<p>
This page describes briefly the command line options to <tt>timberc</tt>, the Timber compiler.
Installation is not described.
<p>
<tt>timberc</tt> expects a number of options and a number of files to compile. The most
common uses are the following:
<ul>
  <li> <tt>timberc -c Mod1.t Mod2.t ...</tt>
  <p> The given files are compiled (first to C by the timber
  compiler, then to object files by the C compiler). No linking takes place. This usage requires that all
  files on which the given modules depend have already been compiled. This is the typical way to compile
  new modules during the development of a Timber system. Can be modified to option <tt>-C</tt> to avoid
  C compilation.
  <li> <tt>timberc --make Mod</tt>
  <p> The compiler expects <tt>Mod.t</tt> to be the root module of a system for the default environment (i.e. POSIX).
  All modules in the system are compiled by <tt>timberc</tt> and <tt>gcc</tt> as needed and in dependency
  order, followed by linking. The executable is called <tt>Mod</tt>. This option obviates the need of a makefile
  to rebuild the system after changes in any modules. Can be combined with <tt>--root=name</tt> when the name of
  the root definition is <tt>name</tt> (rather than the default <tt>root</tt>).
  <li> <tt>timberc Mod.ti</tt>
  <p> Displays the API of module <tt>Mod</tt>, i.e. all exported kinds, types, defaults and top-level values with their types,
  typically in a browser window (installation-dependent).
</ul>
