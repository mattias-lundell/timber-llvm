<h3>EchoServer</h3>
<p>
Now, let's look at a further feature of the <tt>POSIX</tt>
environment. It also supports writing <em>network programs</em>,
that communicate over the Internet using <em>sockets</em>.
A socket can be thought of as a two-way communication channel,
consisting of both an <tt>RFile</tt> and a <tt>WFile</tt>.
<p>
Two network programs, which
execute on different machines, may connect over
the network and communicate using a socket.
Typically, one of the programs will be a <em>server</em>
and the other a <em>client</em>. Here is a trivial server, the
<tt>EchoServer</tt>.
  This server waits indefinitely for clients to connect on port
  12345. When a client connects, the server starts a session, where
  client input rows are echoed back to the client, prefixed by a line
  number. Several clients may be served concurrently and
  line numbering is independent for each client.

<b>module</b> EchoServer <b>where</b>

<b>import</b> POSIX

port = Port 12345

root env = <b>class</b>

    log str = <b>action</b>
       env.stdout.write ('[':str ++ "]\n")

    result <b>action</b>
       env.inet.tcp.listen port (server log)


server log sock = <b>class</b>

   n := 1

   p = show sock.remoteHost

   echo str = <b>action</b>
      sock.outFile.write (show n ++"> "++str)
      n := n+1

   close = <b>request</b>
      log (p ++ " closing")
      <b>result</b> ()

   neterror str = log ("Neterror: "++str)

   established = <b>action</b>
      log ("Connected from " ++ p)
      sock.inFile.installR echo

   <b>result</b> Connection{..}

Comments to the code:
<ul>
  <li> The result action of the root definition just installs a
  listening callback in the environment. Such a callback has type
  <tt>Socket -> Class Connection</tt> where
  <ul>
    <li> a <tt>Socket</tt> object has selectors for the resources
    <em>from</em> the environment
    needed by the serving object: the <tt>remoteHost</tt> and
    <tt>remotePort</tt> and the <tt>inFile</tt> and <tt>outFile</tt>
    parts of the connection.
    <li> a <tt>Connection</tt> implements the services provided
    by the server
    <em>to</em> the environment: an initial action to call when the
    connection is <tt>established</tt>, an action to call with
    an error message when a
    <tt>neterror</tt> occurs and a method to call when the
    remote client wants to <tt>close</tt> the connection.
    </ul>
    <li> The echoing behaviour is achieved by installing,
    when connection is established, the
    <tt>echo</tt> method with the <tt>inFile</tt> of the socket.
    <li> Additionally, the server logs its connections and
    errors, using the logging method
    that it gets as parameter (which logs to <tt>stdout</tt>).
</ul>
<p>
In order to let you run the server, we provide a simple client,
<tt>TCPClient</tt>. We do not list the code here; you may review
it in <tt>TCPClient.t</tt>. The client accepts a host name and a port
number as command line arguments and connects to a server on that
address. When connection is established, the client accepts user input
lines, sends them to the server and displays replies obtained on the
screen.
