<h2>Types and type declarations</h2>
<h3>Types and type constructors</h3>
<p>
Values in Timber are classified into <em>types</em>. The integer value 7 has type <tt>Int</tt>, a fact that is expressed
in Timber as <tt>7 :: Int</tt>, so <tt>::</tt> is read "has type". One seldom adds such explicit type information to expressions
in Timber code, but it is allowed to do so. More common is to supply type signatures as documentation to
top-level definitions, but also these can be omitted, leaving to the Timber compiler to infer types.
<p>
Timber also has <em>type constructors</em>, which can be thought of as functions that take types as arguments and give a type as
result. An example is the primitive type constructor <tt>Request</tt>, which takes a type <em>a</em> as an argument and constructs
the type <tt>Request</tt> <em>a</em> of methods (in the object-oriented sense) returning a value of type <em>a</em>.

<a name="kind"><h3>Kinds and kind declarations</h3></a>
<p>
Timber types and type constructors are classified by their <em>kind</em>. All types have kind <tt>*</tt>, while
type constructors that expect one type argument (such as e.g. <tt>Request</tt>) have
kind <tt>* -> *</tt>. In general, a kind is either <tt>*</tt> or <em>k1</em> <tt>-></tt> <em>k2</em> where <em>k1</em> and 
<em>k2</em> are kinds. A type constructor of kind  <em>k1</em> <tt>-></tt> <em>k2</em> expects an argument of kind <em>k1</em>; 
the result is then a type (constructor) of kind <em>k2</em>.
<p>
The programmer may declare the kind of a type constructor in a top-level kind declaration:<p>
<pre>
<em>con</em> :: <em>kind</em>
</pre>
<p>
This is particularly useful when defining abstract data types; in the public part of a module one declares the kind of
an abstract type and the signatures of the operators; the actual type definition and equations are given in the private part.

<h3>Primitive types</h3>
<p>
We first describe the primitive types of Timber. In Timber code it is always clear from the context whether
an expression denotes a type or a value, so some types use the same syntax for type expressions as for
values, without confusion. (A beginner might disagree about the last two words.)

<h4>Primitive simple types</h4>
<p>
As part of the language, the following primitive types are provided:
<ul>
  <li> The type <tt>Int</tt> of finite-precision integers.</li>
  <li> The type <tt>Float</tt> of single-precision floating-point numbers.</li>
  <li> The type <tt>Char</tt> of characters.</li>
  <li> The type <tt>Time</tt> of time intervals.</li>
  <li> The type <tt>Bool</tt>, with the two values <tt>True</tt> and <tt>False</tt>.</li>
  <li> The type <tt>()</tt> (pronounced "unit"), containing the single value <tt>()</tt>.
  <li> The type <tt>OID</tt> of object identities, which support test for identity between objects.
</ul>
<p>
Literals of types <tt>Int</tt> and <tt>Float</tt> are as in most programming languages; integer constants can be
given in octal or hexadecimal formed if prefixed by <tt>0o</tt> and <tt>0x</tt>, respectively.
<p>
Time values are expressed using the primitive functions <tt>sec</tt>, <tt>millisec</tt>, <tt>microsec</tt> and <tt>nanosec</tt>,
which all take an integer argument and return a <tt>Time</tt> value. Of course, <tt>millisec 1000</tt> and <tt>sec 1</tt> denote
the same value.
<p>
Character literals are written within
single quoutes as in 'a' or '3'; common escaped characters are '\n' and '\t' for newline and tab, respectively. (Many other forms of
character literals omitted.)
<h4>Primitive type constructors</h4>
<p>
The following type constructors are also primitive in the language.
<ul>
<li>Lists.<p>The type <tt>[a]</tt>, for any type <tt>a</tt>, contains finite lists of values of type <tt>a</tt>.
  The list <tt>[3, 6, 7, 1]</tt> has type <tt>[Int]</tt> and <tt>[[3, 2], [4, -1, 7]]</tt> has type <tt>[[Int]]</tt>
  (however, see the overloading page for more general types of these lists).
<li>Tuples.<p>
For arbitrary types <tt>a1</tt>,<tt>a2,</tt><tt>...</tt><tt>an</tt>, we can form the tuple type <tt>(a1, a2, ..., an)</tt>.
Values use the same notation so <tt>(True,'a')</tt> has type <tt>(Bool,Char)</tt>.
</li>
<li>Arrays.<p>
For any type <tt>a</tt>, the type <tt>Array a</tt> consists of a sequence of <tt>a</tt> values, organized so that one can access
all values by index in constant time. Arrays are particularly useful as state variables in objects, where they may also be
updated in imperative style.</li>
<li>Functions.<p> For any two types <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt>, <tt>a -> b</tt> is the type of functions from <tt>a</tt> to <tt>b</tt>.
<tt>-></tt> associates to the right, so <tt>a -> b -> c</tt> parses as <tt> a -> (b -> c)</tt>.
<li>Either.<p>
This type could be defined in Timber as
<pre>
<b>data</b> Either a b = Left a | Right b
</pre>
<p>
It is only primitive because of its role in generating default instances.</li>
<li>Classes.<p>
For any type <tt>a</tt>, the type <tt>Class a</tt> contains templates from which one can instantiate objects
with interface of type <tt>a</tt>. Of particular
interest is the case where <tt>a</tt> is a struct type with a number of methods manipulating an internal state of the object.</li>
<li>Actions.<p>
<tt>Action</tt> is the type of asynhronous methods. An object may offer an <tt>Action</tt> in its interface; a client who
has access to this interface may send the object an action message with appropriate arguments. The message will, at an unspecified 
later point in time, execute the action, with exclusive access to the object's state.</li>
<li>Requests.<p>
For any type <tt>a</tt>, <tt>Request a</tt> is the type of synchronous methods that return a value of type <tt>a</tt>.
An object may offer a <tt>Request</tt> in its interface; a client who has access to this interface may then send a 
request message with appropriate arguments and wait for the result. Since all methods require exclusive access to the state of the
receiving object during execution, cycles of requests lead to deadlock. Deadlock is detected by the runtime system and an exception
is raised.</li>
<li>Commands.<p> For any two types <tt>s</tt> and <tt>a</tt>, <tt>Cmd s a</tt> is the type of procedures that can execute in a
state <tt>s</tt> and return a value of type <tt>a</tt>.
<li> Object references.<p>
For any type <tt>a</tt>, <tt>Ref a</tt> is the type of references to
objects with interface of type <tt>a</tt>.
<li> The struct type <tt>Timer</tt>, which is used as interface to the
primitive timers of the language; see the <a href="time.html">Time
constructs</a> page for details.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Polymorphic types</h3>
<p>
We can now form complex types such as
<p>
<table align=center><TR>
<TH> Examples
</TH></TR>
<TR><TD><tt>Int -> Int -> Bool</tt></TD></TR>
<TR><TD><tt>[Int] -> Int</tt></TD></TR>
<TR><TD><tt>(a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]</tt></TD></TR>
</table>
<p>
The two first examples are <em>monomorphic</em>; they involve only known types and type constructors. The third is 
<em>polymorphic</em>; it involves the type variable <tt>a</tt> (a type variable since it starts with a lower-case letter),
that stands for an arbitrary type. A function possessing this type can be used at any type obtained by substituting a type 
for <tt>a</tt>.
<p>
The type variable <tt>a</tt> is implicitly bound in such a type expression; one should think of an implicit "for all a"
quantification prepended to the type expression.
<a name="type"><h3>Data types</h3></a>
<p>
The programmer may introduce new ways of constructing data by defining <em>data types</em>. The simplest case is 
enumeration types like
<pre>
<b>data</b> Day = Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun
</pre>
The type <tt>Day</tt> contains the seven constructor values that are enumerated in the right hand side.
<p>
The constructors may have arguments, as in
<pre>
<b>data</b> Temp = Fahrenheit Int | Celsius Int
</pre>
<p>
Values in type <tt>Temp</tt> are e.g., <tt>Fahrenheit 451</tt> and <tt>Celsius 100</tt>. There may be one, two or
more alternatives and a constructor may have more than one argument. A data type for a web log entry might be
<pre>
<b>data</b> Entry = Entry IPAddress Date URL Method Int
</pre>
<p>
where a value of type <tt>Entry</tt> might be
<pre>
Entry "123.456.789.000" (May 29 2007) "http://www.abc.def"  GET 321
</pre>
<p>
given suitable type definitions for the other types involved. Note that the type and the constructor have the same name; 
this is OK since types and constructors live in different namespaces.
<p>
We may also define parameterised data types:
<pre>
<b>data</b> Tree a b = Nil | Branch (Tree a b) a b (Tree a b)
</pre>
<p>
<tt>Tree</tt> thus has kind <tt>* -> * -> *</tt> and a  value of type <tt>Tree String Int</tt> is a binary tree with a 
<tt>String</tt> and an <tt>Int</tt> stored in each internal node.
<p>
Two different data types may not use the same constructor name; with the above definition, no other data type 
<em>in the same module</em> can use constructor <tt>Nil</tt>. For data types in imported modules there is no problem 
if they use <tt>Nil</tt>; only that the qualified name must be used for the imported constructor.

<h3>Struct types</h3>
<p>
Struct, or record, types collect values bound to named selectors. Declarations have the syntax
<p>
<pre>
<b>struct</b> <em>con</em> <em>var</em><font color=red>*</font> <b>where</b>
  <em>sig</em><font color=red>+</font>
</pre>
<p>
<table align=center><TR>
<TH> Examples
</TH></TR>
<TR><TD><tt><b>struct</b> Point <b>where</b></tt></TD></TR>
<TR><TD><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;x, y :: Int</tt></TD></TR>
<TR><TD><tt><b>struct</b> Dictionary a b <b>where</b></tt></TD></TR>
<TR><TD><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;insert :: a -> b -> Action</tt></TD></TR>
<TR><TD><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;lookup :: a -> Request (Maybe b)</tt></TD></TR>
</table>
<p>
An example value of type <tt>Point</tt> is <tt>Point {x=3, y=7}</tt>.  The order between the fields is not significant, so
<tt>Point {y=7, x=3}</tt> is the same value. Similarly as for constructors, two different struct types in the
same module may not use the same selector name.
Thus a struct value is uniquely defined by the collection of selectors and the type name can be omitted from the value; 
<tt>{x=3, y=7}</tt> is again the same value.
<p>
If <tt>p :: Point</tt>, the selectors are accessed using dot notation, so the two integer coordinates are
<tt>p.x</tt> and <tt>p.y</tt>, respectively.
<p>
A struct type may have any number of selectors and the types of selectors are arbitrary. A struct type may also be parameterised
as shown by <tt>Dictionary</tt>, a type suitable as an interface to an object that acts as a dictionary, storing information of 
type <tt>b</tt> about keys
of type <tt>a</tt>. (The result type <tt>Maybe b</tt> for <tt>lookup</tt> is intended to capture the possibility that the given
key is not stored in the dictionary; the prelude defines <tt>data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a</tt>.)

<h3>Type synonyms</h3>
<p>
The user may introduce new names for existing types:
<pre>
<b>type</b> Age = Int
<b>type</b> IPAddress = String
<b>type</b> List a = [a]
<b>type</b> Pair a b = (a,b)
</pre>
<p>
Such definitions do not introduce new types; they can only be helpful to improve program readability. They may not be recursive and
can not be partially applied (i.e., <tt>Pair Int</tt> is not a legal type constructor). The prelude introduces one type synonym:
<pre>
<b>type</b> String = [Char]
</pre>
<h3>Subtyping</h3>
<h4>Subtyping for struct types</h4>
<p>
Struct types and data types may be defined in subtype hierarchies. As an example, we can extend <tt>Point</tt>:
<pre>
<b>struct</b> Point3 < Point <b>where</b>
  z :: Int
</pre>
<p>
We define <tt>Point3</tt> to be a subtype of <tt>Point</tt>; for struct types this means that <tt>Point3</tt> has all the selectors
of <tt>Point</tt> and possibly some more (in the example, one more: <tt>z</tt>). So we have <tt>{x=0, y=3, z=5} :: Point3</tt>.
A function that expects a <tt>Point</tt> as argument can be given a <tt>Point3</tt> without problem, since all the function can do
with its argument is use the selectors <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt>, which are present also in a <tt>Point3</tt>.
<p>
As another example we might split the dictionary type into two:
<pre>
<b>struct</b> LookupDict a b <b>where</b>
  lookup :: a -> Request (Maybe b)

<b>struct</b> Dictionary a b < LookupDict a b <b>where</b>
  insert :: a -> b -> Action
</pre>
<p>
In a program we may build a dictionary <tt>dict :: Dictionary a b</tt> and then send it to an unprivileged client typed as a
<tt>LookupDict</tt>; the client can then only lookup information, not insert new key/info pairs.
<p>
A struct type may have several supertypes; given a struct type
<pre>
<b>struct</b> Object <b>where</b>
  self :: OID
</pre>
where <tt>OID</tt> is a type that allows test for equality between objects, we could have defined
<pre>
<b>struct</b> Dictionary a b < LookupDict a b, Object <b>where</b>
  insert :: a -> b -> Action
</pre>
<p>
to get the same effect as before and, in addition, the possibility to test whether two dictionaries are the same (meaning same object,
not equivalent content).
<h4>Subtyping for data types</h4>
<p>
We can also define hierarchies of data types, but these are completely separate from any hierarchy of struct types; a data type
can never be a sub- or supertype of a struct type. For data types we may add new constructors to get a supertype:
<pre>
<b>data</b> CEntry > Entry = Corrupt
</pre>
<p>
Type <tt>CEntry</tt> adds another constructor to the type <tt>Entry</tt> defined above; a <tt>CEntry</tt> is either a proper
entry as above or <tt>Corrupt</tt>. A function that is defined to take a <tt>Entry</tt> as argument cannot accept a <tt>CEntry</tt>;
it may stumble on a <tt>Corrupt</tt> entry. The converse is OK; newly defined functions on <tt>CEntry</tt> values can happily
take an <tt>Entry</tt>; they will not have to use their <tt>Corrupt</tt> case.

<h4>Subtyping among primitive types</h4>
<p>
The following subtyping relations hold between primitive types:<p>
<pre>
Request a < Cmd s a
Action < Cmd s Msg
Ref a < OID
</pre>
<script type="text/javascript"> var gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ? "https://ssl." : "http://www."); document.write(unescape("%3Cscript src='" + gaJsHost + "google-analytics.com/ga.js' type='text/javascript'%3E%3C/script%3E")); </script> <script type="text/javascript"> try { var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker("UA-5102454-2"); pageTracker._trackPageview(); } catch(err) {}</script>
</body> </html>
