<h3>The POSIX environment</h3>
<p>
Timber is intended to be usable in many different
situations, ranging from embedded systems to
standard desktop applications. The interfaces
between the Timber program and the external environment
are very different in these cases.
<p>
Thus a Timber application must be built for a particular target
environment. This distribution provides only one environment,
the POSIX environment. Also this is incomplete and a more complete
version will be provided in a future release.
<pre>
<b>module</b> POSIX <b>where</b>
    
<b>type</b> RootType = Env -> Class Prog

<b>type</b> Prog = Action

<b>struct</b> Env <b>where</b>
    exit      :: Int -> Request ()
    argv      :: Array String
    stdin     :: RFile
    stdout    :: WFile
    openR     :: String -> Request (Maybe RFile)
    openW     :: String -> Request (Maybe WFile)

    close :: Request ()

<b>struct</b> RFile < File <b>where</b>

    installR :: (String -> Action) -> Request ()
    
<b>struct</b> WFile < File <b>where</b>
    write    :: String -> Request Int
    installW :: Action -> Request ()

</pre>
<p>
The root module of a program targeted for this environment must
<tt>import POSIX</tt> and contain
a definition <tt>root :: RootType</tt>.
<p>
Here the type <tt>Env</tt> collects the services that the environment
provides to the program: the program can  call a function <tt>exit</tt>
to terminate the program with a status indication, access command line arguments
through <tt>argv</tt>, the standard input and output streams
as <tt>stdin</tt> and <tt>stdout</tt>, open files for reading and
writing, etc. Within a definition
<pre>
root env = ...
</pre>
these services are accessed using dot notation as <tt>env.argv</tt> etc.
<p>
The <tt>read</tt> and <tt>write</tt> on files are <em>non-blocking</em> operations:
<ul>
  <li><tt>read</tt> returns a string of the bytes that are available
  in the file at the time of the call. If no input is available, the empty string is returned.
  Input is line-buffered, so no input is available until the user strikes return.
  <li> <tt>write</tt> takes a string as argument and tries to write it to the file;
  the returned value is the number of characters written; for regular files this should be
  expected to be the length of the argument.
</ul>
<p>
Because of the non-blocking nature of input and output, programs need a way to be notified
when input is available or output is possible. This is the role of <em>listeners</em>
or <em>callbacks</em>; a call
<p>
<pre>
env.stdin.installR inpHandler
</pre>
<p>
installs the action <tt>inpHandler</tt> as a listener on <tt>stdin</tt>; whenever input
is available (i.e. the user strikes return), the runtime system calls the listener with
the input line as argument.
<p>
The <tt>startTime</tt> denotes a <tt>Time</tt> value, representing the time elapsed since
the Epoch.  One main use of this value is that its least significant part can
serve as random generator seed.
<p>The <ttEnv</tt> selector <tt>inet</tt> provides support for network programming, described on
a <a href="inet.html">separate page</a>.
<p>
Execution of a program proceeds as follows. The runtime system is responsible
for initialization: it creates
an environment object with interface <tt>env :: Env</tt>, applies <tt>root</tt> to <tt>env</tt> and
creates an object of the resulting class; this gives an interface to the initial action of the program.
The run-time system executes this action; this may
lead to creation of more objects, scheduling of future actions etc.
<p>
After this initial computation the program comes to rest and
reacts to events, such as scheduled timer events or IO events on files with installed listeners.
