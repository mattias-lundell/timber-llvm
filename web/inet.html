<h3>Network programming</h3>
<p>
The POSIX environment provides basic support for network programming
over TCP sockets. We repeat part of module <tt>POSIX</tt>:
<pre>
<b>module</b> POSIX <b>where</b>

...

<b>data</b> Host = Host String
<b>data</b> Port = Port Int

<b>struct</b> Internet <b>where</b>
    tcp :: Sockets

<b>struct</b> Socket < Closable <b>where</b>
    remoteHost :: Host
    remotePort :: Port
    inFile     :: RFile
    outFile    :: WFile

<b>struct</b> Connection < Closable <b>where</b> 
    established :: Action
    neterror    :: String -> Action

<b>struct</b> Sockets <b>where</b>
   connect :: Host -> Port ->
              (Socket -> Class Connection) -> Request()
   listen  :: Port ->
              (Socket -> Class Connection) -> Request Closable

<b>instance</b> showHost :: Show Host
showHost = <b>struct</b>
   show (Host nm) = nm
</pre>
<p>
Typically, a network program consists of two program parts, a <em>client</em>
and a <em>server</em>, executing on different hosts, connected to
the internet. The parts communicate over a <em>socket</em>, an
abstraction of a communication channel. A socket has selectors to give
the host and port of the remote peer and two files, an <tt>RFile</tt>
for reading and a <tt>WFile</tt> for writing. The main body of both the
server and the client is a function of type <tt>Socket -> Class Connection</tt>.
This function has access to a socket and must define methods
describing how to handle the events a network program must react to:
 an <tt>established</tt> message when the cnnection has been established, a
<tt>neterror</tt> message in case of problems and a <tt>close</tt>
message from the remote peer.
<p>
The client tries to <tt>connect</tt> to a server by specifying a
host and a port; the server just specifies a port on which to
<tt>listen</tt>. Whenever a client connects to a host on a port
and there is a server listening on that port, a socket is created
for each party with files set up for communication and an
<tt>established</tt>
message is sent to both parties. Typically, code in the body of
<tt>established</tt> will register callbacks with the
infiles.
<p> For examples, see <a
href="EchoServer_descr.html"><tt>EchoServer</tt></a>
and <tt>TCPClient</tt>.
<p> Presently, only TCP sockets are supported. A future release may
provide support for UDP sockets.
