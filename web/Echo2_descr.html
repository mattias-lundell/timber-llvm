<h3>Echo2</h3>

<p>
Let us make the <tt>Echo</tt> program just a little bit more
interesting: We add an initial welcome phrase and a
prompt with a line number. Here is the program:
<hr>
<pre>
<b>module</b> Echo2 <b>where</b>

<b>import</b> POSIX

root env = <b>class</b>

   count := 1

   prompt = <b>do</b>
      env.stdout.write (show count++"> ")
      count := count+1

   echo str = <b>action</b>
      env.stdout.write str
      prompt

   <b>result</b>
      <b>action</b>
         env.stdin.installR echo
         env.stdout.write "Welcome to Echo2!\n"
         prompt
</pre>
<hr>
<p>
The root definition now has two more components:
<ul>
  <li> The (implicit) declaration and initialisation of the state
      variable <tt>count</tt>, which will maintain line numbers.
  <li> The auxiliary procedure <tt>prompt</tt>, which writes
  a prompt to the user and increases the line count.
</ul>
<p>
In addition, the callback and the initial action both call
<tt>prompt</tt>, and a greeting phrase is added.
<p>
Some additional details:
<ul>
  <li> <p>The keyword <tt><b>do</b></tt> signifies the start of a,
  typically local, procedure, that may be called from other methods
  as above.</li>
  <li> <p><tt>show</tt> is a function that converts
  the integer value <tt>count</tt> to a string; <tt>++</tt>
  denotes string concatenation. Both these are defined in
  the <tt>Prelude</tt>, a library module which is implicitly imported by
  all modules.</li>
  <li> <p>The user input string given to <tt>echo</tt> will include
  the newline; hence so will the string echoed to <tt>stdout</tt>.
  But to write the welcome phrase on a separate line, it will have
  to end with an explicit newline.</li>
  <li> The root object maintains  state variable
  <tt>count</tt>, which is initialised to 1 and increased for each
      prompt written. Obviously, it would be possible to use
  a <tt>counter</tt> object here, but in this simple program that
      seems an overkill. 
  <li> A more careful description of what the runtime system does
  when the program is run is the following: it creates an object of type
      <tt>Env</tt>,
  applies function <tt>root</tt> to that object, creates an object
  of the resulting class and invokes the resulting action.
