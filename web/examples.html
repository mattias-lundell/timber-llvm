<h3>Tutorial examples</h3>
<p>
This directory contains a number of simple Timber examples.
In addition to the pages that describe the programs and comment on
the code, the source files are here and can be compiled and run.
<p>
Module <tt>Echo</tt> is stored in file <tt>Echo.t</tt> and is compiled
and linked by the shell command
<pre>
timberc --make=Echo
</pre>
which produces an executable file called <tt>Echo</tt> which can be
run by the command
<pre>
./Echo
</pre>
<p>
This is generalized in the expected way to other programs;
the <tt>--make</tt> option makes sure that all
(recursively) imported modules are compiled in the proper order
before linking is done.
<p>
Some programs require a command line argument as described in the
respective page.
<p> A brief summary of the programs is the following:
<ul>
  <li><a href="Echo_descr.html"><tt>Echo</tt></a>. The archetypical reactive program: user input is
  read line by line and echoed to the screen.
  <li><a href="Counter_descr.html"><tt>Counter</tt></a>. The quintessential stateful class; its instances
  maintain an integer value that can be increased and decreased.
  <li><a href="Echo2_descr.html"><tt>Echo2</tt></a>. Slight extension of <tt>Echo</tt>: the output
  lines are decorated with line numbers, thus adding state to the
  root definition.
  <li><a href="Echo3_descr.html"><tt>Echo3</tt></a>. Another extension: The last input line is
  repeatedly echoed once per second, showing use of Timber time
  constructs.
  <li><a href="EchoServer_descr.html"><tt>EchoServer</tt></a>. Still a variation: Echoing user input
  over the Internet.
  <li><a href="EchoServer2_descr.html"><tt>EchoServer2</tt></a>. A variation of the previous: limiting
  the number of concurrently served clients.
  <li><a href="Reflex_descr.html"><tt>Reflex</tt></a>. A simple reaction time tester.
  <li><a href="MasterMind_descr.html"><tt>MasterMind</tt></a>. A bit more complex: The user chooses a
  secret in MasterMind and the program does the guessing.
  <li><a href="Primes_descr.html">Primes</a>. A degenerate reactive program: computes and prints the number of
  primes smaller than a given bound and terminates.
  <li><a href="PingTimeServers_descr.html">PingTimeServers</a>. Asks a number of network time servers for the current time.
