<h3>Timber for Haskell programmers</h3>
<p>
Much of Timber syntax is taken from Haskell, so the Haskell programmer glancing
through Timber code will feel at home. This page summarizes instead the most important
<em>differences</em> between Timber and Haskell.
<p>
<ul>
  <li> Timber has strict semantics, not lazy as Haskell. This has a major impact on the
  programming styles of the two languages.
  <li> Timber has Haskell-like type classes, but with slightly 
  different syntax for both type class and instance declarations. The reserved word starting a
  type class declaration is <tt>typeclass</tt>.
  The main reason for this change is that the word <tt>class</tt>
  in Timber is used to denote the well-known concept from object-oriented programming.
 Instances of such types are
  named values of the type, tagged by <tt>instance</tt>. The following excerpt from
  the Prelude illustrates the concept.
 <pre>
<b>typeclass</b> Eq a <b>where</b> 
  (==),(/=) :: a -> a -> Bool


<b>instance</b> eqUnit :: Eq () 
eqUnit = <b>struct</b>
  _ == _ = True
  _ /= _ = False
</pre>
  <p>
One cannot attach a <tt>deriving</tt>-clause to a data type definition. Instead, one can separately
request default instances of some type classes.
<li> In addition to data types, Timber has a dual notion of struct types. For both data and struct types there is a notion
  of subtyping with inclusion polymorphism. 
<li> Qualified types have another syntax in Timber. To illustrate, here is the definition of the function <tt>elem</tt>
  from the Prelude:
  <pre>
elem :: a -> [a] -> Bool \\ Eq a
elem x []           = False
elem x (y : ys)     = x == y || elem x ys
</pre>
<p>
  Note: A call to <tt>elem</tt> will evaluate both arguments
  completely (because the language is strict), but will not traverse its second argument
  further when an equality becomes <tt>True</tt> (because the disjunction "operator" <tt>||</tt> is non-strict
  in its right operand).
<li> In Timber one can express monadic computations using <tt>do</tt>-notation, but this is reserved for a particular primitive
   monad <tt>Cmd s</tt> of commands operating on a state <tt>s</tt>. It is possible to define the concept of a general
  monad as in Haskell (it is in fact defined in the prelude), but the <tt>do</tt>-notation is not available for general monads.
<li> The Cmd monad provides powerful constructs for object-oriented programming, with objects encapsulating a local
state and methods manipulating this state. This is achieved while retaining the pure nature of the language; a computation with
side-effects is clearly indicated by a monadic type (and can hence not be used in a non-monadic context).
<p>
Further, methods execute concurrently, but with exclusive access to the state of the object; thus Timber is also a concurrent
language with some real-time constructs. 
  <li> The main program of a Timber program is not of type <tt>IO ()</tt> (this type does not exist in Timber), but there must
be a designated root module with a root definition; the type of this depends on the target environment. In the present
distribution, only a rudimentary <a href="posix.html">POSIX environment</a> is provided.
<li> The type system of Timber implements many of the non-standard features that are implemented as extensions in GHC. See
more details on the page that discusses <a href="advanced.html">advanced features of the type system</a>.
