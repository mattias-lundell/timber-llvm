<h3>Echo</h3>

<p>
Our first example runs in a very simple setting: a computing environment
where the interaction between the external world and the program is through a keyboard and a text screen.
The user provides input using the keyboard and the program prints
output on the screen.
<p>
We consider a reactive program, where the user 
input is just echoed on the screen, line by line,
by the program. This trivial interaction, the "Hello, world" of
reactive programs, goes on indefinitely.
<p>
Here is the program:
<hr>
<pre>
<b>module</b> Echo <b>where</b>

<b>import</b> POSIX

root env = <b>class</b>

   echo str = <b>action</b>
      env.stdout.write str

   <b>result</b> 
      <b>action</b> 
         env.stdin.installR echo
</pre>
<hr>
<p>
Let us explain the program:
<ul>
  <li> The first line just states the name of the module.</li>
  <li> Line 3 contains an import declaration; we will use resources from
<tt>POSIX</tt>,  a predefined library module that provides the types
  needed to build programs for simple environment we described above.
  <p>
Module <tt>POSIX</tt> defines a struct type <tt>Env</tt>, with selectors
corresponding to the resources available to the program in its interaction
with the environment.
Among these are <tt>stdin</tt>, which refers to the keyboard,
and <tt>stdout</tt>, which refers to the screen.</li>
<li>
Module <tt>POSIX</tt> also acts as the default
<em>target environment</em> for Timber programs.
This target environment prescribes that a program
must contain a <em>root definition</em>
  <pre>
root :: Env -> Class Action
</pre>
<p>

In module <tt>Echo</tt>, this definition starts on line 5 and
makes up the rest of the program.
<p>
<tt>root</tt> must describe the initial behaviour of the program in its
<tt>result</tt> action, which terminates the class definition.
<p>
In addition, it may make auxiliary definitions; here of
the function <tt>echo</tt>, which describes how the program
reacts to an input string <tt>str</tt>.
The resulting action just installs this function as
a callback with <tt>env.stdin</tt>.
</ul>
<p> When executed, the runtime system invokes the
result action of the root definition (see
<a href="Echo2_descr.html"><tt>Echo2</tt></a> for a more careful description.)
After that, the program is idle, waiting for user input.
When such (line-buffered) input occurs, the runtime system
invokes the callback with the input line as argument.
<p>
This trivial program is typical for the Timber programming idiom;
we describe how the program should react to external events and
install, or register, this description with the external device.
<p>
We note, finally, that the use of <tt>stdout</tt> and
<tt>stdin</tt> is consistent with their types as
specified in <tt>Env</tt>:
<ul>
  <li> <tt>stdout</tt>
is a <tt>WFile</tt> and thus has a <tt>write</tt> method;
  <li> <tt>stdin</tt> is a <tt>RFile</tt>, and thus has an
<tt>installR</tt> method.
  </ul>
