<h3>Type classes and qualified types</h3>
<p>
In mathematics and in most programming languages, <tt>+</tt> and <tt>-</tt> denote addition and subtraction; but what should
their types be? Of course, we want to be able to add both integers and floating-point numbers, but these two functions correspond to
completely different machine operations; we may also want to define arithmetic on new types, such as complex or rational numbers.
<p>
To better understand the problem, consider a function to add the elements of a list of integers to an accumulator.
Assuming that <tt>+</tt> only means integer addition we could define
<pre>
add :: Int -> [Int] -> Int
add acc (x : xs) = add (x + acc) xs
add acc [] = acc
</pre>
<p>
As long as there are elements in the list, we add them to the accumulator and call the function recursively; when the list is empty the
accumulator holds the result.
<p> But this function makes perfect sense also for floats (or rationals, or complex numbers, or ...) and we would like to use it at
those types, too. One could imagine an ad hoc solution just for the arithmetic operators, but we prefer a general solution.
<p>
A first step is to introduce the following struct type:
<pre>
<b>struct</b> Num a <b>where</b>
  (+), (-), (*) :: a -> a -> a
</pre>
<p>
A value of type <tt>Num Int</tt> has three fields, defining addition,
subtraction and multiplication, respectively, on integers. (Of course, we can construct an object of this type using any three functions
of the prescribed type, but the intention is to supply the standard arithmetic operators.) Similarly, a value of type <tt>Num Float</tt>
defines the corresponding operators for floating-point numbers.
<p>
Assume that we have
properly defined struct value <tt>numInt :: Num Int</tt>. We can then define 
<pre>
add :: Int -> [Int] -> Int
add acc (x : xs) = add (numInt.(+) x acc) xs
add acc [] = acc
</pre>
<p>
Of course, the first argument in the recursive call now looks horrible; it would be silly to write integer addition in this way. 
But it has now become easy to generalize the code by abstracting out the <tt>Num</tt> object as an argument:
<pre>
add :: Num a -> a -> [a] -> a
add d acc (x : xs) = add d (d.(+) x acc) xs
add d acc [] = acc
</pre>
<p>
This version of <tt>add</tt> can be used for lists of any type of objects for which we can define the arithmetic operators, at 
the expense of passing an extra argument to the function.
<p>
The final step that gives an acceptable solution is to <em>let the compiler</em> handle the <tt>Num</tt> objects. We do this by declaring
<tt>Num</tt> to be a  <em>type class</em>, loosely following the terminology introduced in Haskell:
<pre>
<b>typeclass</b> Num
</pre>
<p>
For any such type, its selectors can be used <em>without</em> the
dot notation identifying a struct value from which to select. Whenever a selector of a type class occurs in a function
body, the compiler does the following:
<ul>
<li> adds an extra parameter of the type class to the function;</li>
<li> changes the selector occurrences in the function body to a selection from that parameter.</li>
<li> wherever the function is used, adds an object of the proper type as an extra argument.
<li> changes the type of the function to be a <em>qualified type</em>; the type class occurs as a constraint after <tt>\\</tt>.
</ul>
<p>
With <tt>Num</tt> defined as a type class, our running example becomes
<pre>
add :: a -> [a] -> a \\ Num a
add acc (x : xs) = add (x + acc) xs
add acc [] = acc
</pre>
<p>
As a convenience, the declaration of the struct type and the type class declaration can be combined into one single declaration:
<pre>
<b>typeclass</b> Num a <b>where</b>
  (+), (-), (*) :: a -> a -> a
</pre>
<p>
To use function <tt>add</tt> to sum a list of integers, we would like to write e.g. <tt>add 0 [1, 7, 4]</tt>. The compiler must now insert
the extra argument <tt>numInt</tt>, a struct value with selectors for the three arithmetic operators at type <tt>Int</tt>.
However, since there might be several objects of type <tt>Num Int</tt> defined, we must indicate in  <tt><b>instance</b></tt> declarations
the objects that are to be used at different types.
<pre>
<b>instance</b> numInt :: Num Int
</pre>
An instance declaration is essentially just a type signature flagged with the additional information that the corresponding value 
is available for automatic argument insertion by the compiler.
For convenience, an instance declaration and its struct value definition can also be combined 
into one declaration. As an example, here is an instance of <tt>Num</tt> for rational numbers:
<pre>
<b>data</b> Rational = Rat Int Int

<b>instance</b> numRat :: Num Rational <b>where</b>
  Rat a b + Rat c d = Rat (a*d + b*c) (b*d)
  Rat a b + Rat c d = Rat (a*d - b*c) (b*d)
  Rat a b * Rat c d = Rat (a*c) (b*d)
</pre>
<p>
This definition should be improved by reducing the fractions using Euclid's algorithm, but we omit that. We just note that the arithmetic operators in
the right hand sides are at type <tt>Int</tt>; thus the compiler will insert the proper operations from the instance <tt>numInt</tt>, avoiding
the overhead of extra parameters.
<p>
This solution combines ease of use and flexibility with type security. A possible disadvantage is inefficiency; an extra parameter is passed
around. To address this, the user may add a specific type signature; if the user assigns the type <tt>Int -> [Int] -> Int</tt> to <tt>add</tt>,
giving up flexibility, the compiler will not add the extra parameter, instead inserting integer operations directly into the function body.
<p>
Several type classes, including <tt>Num</tt>, are defined in the Prelude, together with instances for common cases.
<p>
The compiler must be able to select the proper object of a type class to use whenever a function with a qualified type is used; this choice
is guided by the context of the function application. In certain cases ambiguites can occur; these are resolved using default declarations.
<p>
Normally, the combined declaration forms are used both for type classes and instances. Separate typeclass declaration of a struct type can only
be done in the module where the struct type is defined.
<h4>Subtyping constraints</h4>
<p>
Also subtyping relations may be used as constraints in qualified types. As a simple example, consider the function
<pre>
twice f x = f (f x)
</pre>
<p>
Obviously, <tt>twice</tt> has a polymorphic type. At first, it seems that the type should be
<pre>
(a -> a) -> a -> a
</pre>
However, it can be assigned the more general type
<pre>
twice :: (a -> b) -> a -> b \\ b &lt; a
</pre>
Types with subtype constraints will never be assigned by the compiler through type inference, but can be accepted in type-checking.
