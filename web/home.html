<p>
Timber is a general programming language specifically aimed at the construction of complex
<b>event-driven</b> systems. It allows programs to be conveniently structured in terms of
<b>objects</b> and <b>reactions</b>, and the real-time behavior of reactions can furthermore 
be precisely controlled via platform-independent <b>timing constraints</b>. This property 
makes Timber particularly suited to both the specification and the implementation of real-time 
embedded systems.
<p>
Timber is deeply rooted in the <b>functional programming</b> tradition, although it also 
draws heavily on <b>object-oriented</b> concepts, and has the notion of <b>concurrent 
execution</b> built into its core.
