<h3>Statements</h3>
<p>
Statements form the bodies of classes. Within the sequence of statements forming a class definition, there may (and indeed, typically
will) also occur definitions of actions and requests, which themselves have statement sequences as their bodies.
<p>
Statements will typically have side-effects, affecting the state of objects or the external world. This implies that the order of
statements within a sequence is important. 
<p>
Expressions within a statement sequence may furthermore refer to the state variables of the enclosing object.  The values thus obtained
are the current state values at the time of executing each statement.  In particular, a function referencing to a state variable in 
its body is referring to the value of that variable at the point of function definition, not the possible values the variable might 
have when the function is called.
<p>
The available statement forms are:
<ul>
<li>
State variable initialization<p>
<pre>
<em>svar</em> := <em>expr</em>
</pre>
<p>
Here <em>svar</em> is a state variable. These have the same syntax as ordinary variables and share namespace, but
there are no rules for shadowing, so a state variable must be distinct from all ordinary variables in scope (and from other,
already defined state variables in scope). The variable
being defined may not occur in the right hand side. Initialization implicitly declares this variable as part of the state of objects
instantiated from this class.
<li>
List of bindings.
<p> These have the same syntax as binding lists in general; adjacent bindings are mutually recursive and
the bound variables scope over the rest of the statement sequence.
<p> In addition, bindings in a statement sequence can be of the special form
<pre>
<em>pat</em> = <b>new</b> <em>expr</em>
</pre>
which is the syntax used for instatiating objects from a class.
Here <em>expr</em> must evaluate to a class; the effect is that a new object is created, its state initialized and its
interface is matched against to <em>pat</em>
<li> The result statement.<p>
<pre>
<b>result</b> <em>expr</em>
</pre>
In the sequence of statements of a class, this must be the last statement. It defines the interface of the class; i.e., how
the creator of an object may interact with it.
<p> Within an action or a request, the result statement thod and the value returned (for
requests; for actions the result is <tt>()</tt>, the dummy value of type <tt>()</tt>).
</ul>
<p>
The forms of statements up to now are the only forms that may occur in the statement sequence of a class;
creating an object
may only involve initiating the state, creating other objects and returning the proper interface. The remaining forms
occur only within methods and procedures.
<ul>
<li>
State update.<p>
<pre>
<em>svar</em> <font color=red>(</font>! <em>expr</em> <font color=red>)*</font> := <em>expr</em>
</pre>
The left hand side is here either a state variable or an array L-value (when the <em>svar</em> is an array). Array indexing
is denoted by the <tt>!</tt> operator; several indexing operations may occur for multidimensional arrays. The right hand side may
mention this and other state variables.</li>
<li>
Request/procedure call.
<p>
<pre>
<em>pat</em> <- <em>expr</em>
</pre>
Here the right hand side must evaluate to a request or procedure; the statement expresses a call of this method and matching
the pattern against the returned value.
<p>
The alternative form<p>
<pre>
<em>expr</em>
</pre>
may also denote a request or procedure call where the binding is omitted or an action call (which does not return  a value).
<p>
<a href="expr.html#after">After/before expressions</a> are often used as statements in this way.
<li>
Conditional statement.
<p>
<pre>
<b>if</b> <em>expr</em> <b>then</b>
  <em>stmts</em>
<b>elsif</b> <em>expr</em> <b>then</b>
  <em>stmts</em>
<b>else</b>
  <em>stmts</em>
</pre>
<p>
The <tt><b>elsif</b></tt> may occur zero or more times; the <tt><b>else</b></tt> part zero or one time.
<li>
Case statement.<p>
<pre>
<b>case</b> <em>expr</em> <b>of</b>
  <font color=red>(</font><em>pat</em> -> <em>stmts</em><font color=red>)+</font>
</pre>
The alternatives may use guards and/or where clauses just as in function bindings.
<li> Forall statement.
<p>
<pre>
<b>forall</b> <font color= red>(</font><em>qual</em><font color= red>)+</font> <b>do</b>
  <em>stmts</em>
</pre>
Here the simplest form of <em>qual</em> is <tt><em>var</em> <- <em>expr</em></tt>, where <em>expr</em> evaluates
to a list. The statement sequence in the body will be executed once for each element of the list, with <em>var</em> bound to
that element.  Note especially that if an expression in <em>qual</em> references a state variable, the value thus obtained
will be the state variable value at the beginning of the loop, not any new state that might result after executing the
enclosed statement sequence.
</ul>  
We finish with a simple example.
<pre>
<b>struct</b> Counter <b>where</b>
  inc   :: Action
  read  :: Request Int
  reset :: Action

counter = <b>class</b>
  s := 0
  inc = <b>action</b>
    s := s+1
  read = <b>request</b>
    result s
  reset = <b>action</b>
    s := 0
  <b>result</b> Counter {..}
