<h3>Current limitations</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Compiler error messages, especially those resulting from type errors, are far from satisfactory.
<li>
Recursive typeclass instances are naively generated, sometimes resulting in extensive work
duplication.
<li>
Garbage collection of objects with a state including arrays is sensitive to an (unlikely) 
race condition that may cause state updates to be forgotten.
<li>
The <tt><b>abort</b></tt> primitive will sometimes fail to abort a message that has been scheduled
to start but yet not been received.
<li>
Deadlock detection is currently not implemented.
<li>
The Prelude module is very preliminary. As for the library, this release
offers only a small selection of modules to support examples and indicate possible structure.
  
</ul>


<h3>Plans for the next release (Q1 2009)</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Fix the <tt><b>abort</b></tt> and deadlock detection deficiencies.
<li>
Add multidimensional flat arrays to the compiler back-end language, which will
improve the efficiency of array operations in general (and also solve the garbage collection
problem mentioned above).
<li>
Merge the Timber 
<a href="http://www.csee.ltu.se/~pj/papers/scp/popl09-scp.pdf" target="_blank">supercompiler</a>
into the main branch of the implementation, thereby adressing 
the generated code quality of recursive terms overall, including recursively defined instances.
<li>
Make a substantial overhaul of the error reporting infrastructure of the compiler.
<li>
Add a GUI interface to the POSIX run-time environment.
<li>
Provide a proof-of-concept run-time environment for a bare-metal target platform: the ARM7.
</ul>


<h3>Longer term plans</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Add exception handling to the language.
<li>
Extend the type system with support for functional dependencies.
<li>
Turn subtyping coercions into simple casts along the left branch of every subtype hierarchy.
<li>
Extend the syntax to allow explicit <em>self</em> parameters, explicit state types and explicit 
overloading witnesses.
<li>
Implement a generic OpenGL interface.
<li>
Add support for more bare-metal target platforms.
