<h3>Programs</h3>
<p>
A Timber program consists of a collection of <em>modules</em>. One of these is the <em>root</em> module and contains the <em>root
definition</em>. The root definition must have a prescribed <em>root type</em>, that may depend on the <em>target environment</em>.
A Timber installation may support several target environments/platforms.
<p>
The other modules in the program provide auxiliary definitions, used by the root module and by other auxiliary modules.
The compilation unit in Timber is the module, so modules may be compiled individually (but see below for dependencies).

<h3>Modules</h3>

The syntax of a Timber module is
<p>
<tt><b>module</b></tt> <em>moduleName</em> <tt><b>where</b></tt><br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>importDeclaration</em><font color=red>*</font><br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>topLevelDeclaration</em><font color=red>*</font><br><br>
<tt><b>private</b></tt><br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>topLevelDeclaration</em><font color=red>*</font><br><br>

<p>
Here, as in many places of Timber syntax, indentation is significant. The import and top-level declarations must be indented at
least one step and be vertically aligned, i.e., the first character of each declaration must be in the same column.
An exception is the (common) case where there is no private part; then indentation can be omitted (and all declarations start in the
leftmost column).
<h4>Module names</h4>
<p>
A module has a simple name, which is an identifier starting with an
upper-case letter. Modules are conventionally stored in files of the same name with suffix <tt>.t</tt>, i.e.
module <tt>Dictionary</tt> is stored in <tt>Dictionary.t</tt>.
<p>
Projects and Timber sites may use hierarchical module names to allow multiple modules with the same name
or to indicate structure e.g. in a library. Thus, module <tt>Dictionary</tt> may need to be referred to by
clients as e.g. <tt>Data.Object.Dictionary</tt>; it is up to the implementation whether this module is
stored in <tt>Data.Object.Dictionary.t</tt> or in <tt>Data/Object/Dictionary.t</tt>
relative to some installation-dependent notion of search paths. Module hierarchies in Timber have no other significance
than to support organizing and subsequently finding modules in a file system.
<p>
The module name is given in the header, as described above. 
</pre>
<h4>Dependencies</h4>
<p>
A module may depend on other modules, i.e. use types or values defined in these modules. In a Timber program
the dependency graph between modules must be acyclic; no recursive dependencies are allowed. This means that
modules can be compiled in dependency order: when a certain module is compiled, all the modules it depends on have already
been compiled. A compiler option can make the compiler decide on recompilation order after a system has been changed.

<h4>Import and use of other modules</h4>
<p>
Following the header is a sequence of import/use declarations, i.e. declaration of the modules that the current module depends on.
There are two forms of such declarations:
<ul>
  <li> <em>Import declarations</em>, exemplified by<br>
  <tt><b>import</b> Data.Objects.Dictionary</tt></li>
  <li> <em>Use declarations</em>, as in<br>
  <tt><b>use</b> Data.Objects.Dictionary</tt></li>
</ul>
<p>
Both forms of declaration give access to all exported entities from the named module; the difference is that in the latter case
one must use the qualified name of an imported entity, while in the former case the simple (unqualified) name is enough, unless name
clashes occur.
<p>
Name clashes are handled as follows:
<ul>
  <li> Within a module, name clashes are forbidden in the sense that one cannot define two top-level
  entities within the same namespace and with the same name. Thus the exported names from a module cannot clash.</li>
  <li> Fully qualified names are supposed to never clash, i.e., a Timber installation is supposed to be set up so
  that fully qualified module names are globally unique. Thus <tt>use</tt> of a module can never lead to name clashes
  and clashes on <tt>import</tt> can be resolved by resorting to qualified names.</li>
  <li> If a module imports two entities with the same simple name from two different modules, this simple name is not in
  scope in the importing module; the qualified names must be used. The Timber compiler emits a warning when such situations
  occur.</li>
  <li> If a module imports an entity with the same simple name as a locally defined top-level entity, the local definition
  shadows the import, i.e. the simple name is in scope and refers to the locally defined entity.</li>
  </ul>
<h4>Exports</h4>
<p>
  All the entities (types, defaults and values) defined in the sequence of public top-level declarations are exported, i.e. can
  be referred to by importing/using modules. Entities defined in the private part are not exported and hence not visible to importing/using
  modules. In particular, this means that the type environment of the public part must be closed, i.e. the type of an exported value
  must not mention a type defined in the private part. Imported entities are re-exported, i.e.the import relation is transitive:
  if module C imports B, which imports A, the entities in A are visible in C, even if C does not explicitly import A. If the
  only chain from module C to module A passes a "use" declaration, though, entities defined in A must be referred to in C by their qualified
  names.
