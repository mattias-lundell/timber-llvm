<h3>Counter</h3>

<p>
The Counter example is a minimal example of a class from which one
can instantiate objects with state. Several variations are possible;
here is the one we choose:
<hr>
<pre>
<b>module</b> Counter <b>where</b>

<b>struct</b> Counter <b>where</b>
  incr  :: Action
  decr  :: Action
  value :: Request Int

counter = <b>class</b>

   n := 0

   incr  = <b>action</b> n := n+1

   decr  = <b>action</b> n := n-1
   
   value = <b>request</b> result n

   <b>result</b> Counter{..}
</pre>
<hr>
<p>
Comments:
<ul>
  <li> The first four lines of the module body
  define a <tt>struct</tt>, or record, type,
  called <tt>Counter</tt>. This type has three <em>methods</em>,
  and will act as an interface to counter objects.
  <li> The rest of the module defines a class <tt>counter</tt>.
  Instances of this class have an internal state consisting of a
  single integer state variable <tt>n</tt>, initialised to 0 when
  the instance is created. The effects on the state when methods
  are invoked on this object is described. Finally, the
  <tt>result</tt> statement declares that object creation
  returns a <tt>Counter</tt> interface to the object.
  Thus <tt>counter</tt> has type <tt>Class Counter</tt>.
  <li> To create an object of this class, one writes (within a method
  or another class definition)
  <pre>
ctr = <b>new</b> counter
</pre>
The variable <tt>ctr</tt> has type <tt>Counter</tt>, and the newly
  created object can be updated by method calls <tt>ctr.incr</tt> and
  <tt>ctr.decr</tt>. The state can be read by
  <pre>
val <- ctr.value
</pre>
  <li> Any method call has exclusive access to the state of the
  object; there is no need for the programmer to protect calls
  further.
  <li> The two <tt>action</tt> methods are invoked asynchronously,
  while the value-returning <tt>request</tt> of course requires
  synchronous communication.
    <li> The notation <tt>Counter{..}</tt> means "assemble an
    object of type <tt>Counter</tt> from definitions in scope".
    It would be possible, and maybe preferrable in this small example,
    to define the methods within the result expression as follows:
<pre>
counter = <b>class</b>

   n := 0

   <b>result</b>
     <b>struct</b>
       incr  = <b>action</b> n := n+1
       decr  = <b>action</b> n := n-1
       value = <b>request</b> result n
</pre>
In more complex situations, the <tt>{..}</tt> is a useful convenience.

</ul>
<hr>
<h4>Variation</h4>
Java programmers and others may miss constructor methods in the class
definition. In fact, <tt>counter</tt> itself has the role played
by constructor methods as seen from the usage indication above. To,
hopefully, make this clearer we note that one might want to create
counter objects with some other initial value than 0. We can easily
achieve this by a slight modification of <tt>counter</tt>:
<pre>
counterInit init = <b>class</b>
  
   n := init

   ...
</pre>
The rest of the class is as before. To create an object with initial
value 5, we would write
<pre>
ctr = <b>new</b> counterInit 5
</pre>
<p>
Thus, we have the typing <tt>counterInit :: Int -> Class Counter</tt>.
<p>
We might still keep the definition of <tt>counter</tt>, but this would
mean code duplication that should be avoided. Instead, we could write
<pre>
counter = counterInit 0
</pre>
and get a class <tt>counter</tt> with the same usage as our original
definition.
