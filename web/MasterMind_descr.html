<h3>MasterMind</h3>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)">MasterMind</a> is a board game with two players; in this
case the user chooses the secret and the program does the guessing.
Here is a sample interaction:
<pre>
examples> ./MasterMind
Welcome to Mastermind!
Choose your secret. Press return when ready.

My guess: Red Blue Blue Red
Answer (two integers): 1 1
My guess: Blue Black Yellow Red
Answer (two integers): 2 0
My guess: Green Black Red Red
Answer (two integers): 0 0
My guess: Blue Blue Yellow White
Answer (two integers): 3 0
My guess: Blue Blue Yellow Blue
Answer (two integers): 3 0
My guess: Blue Blue Yellow Yellow
Answer (two integers): 4 0
Yippee!
Do you want to play again? (y/n) n
examples> 
</pre>
The program is rather long and is appended at the end of this page. 
We only note a few things:
<ul>
  <li> The program makes use of two library modules
  <tt>Data.Functional.List</tt> and <tt>RandomGenerator</tt>. These
   are parts of the (presently very experimental) Timber library.
  <li> The program complains if the user gives contradictory answers,
  asks for the secret and explains the user's mistake.
  </ul>
