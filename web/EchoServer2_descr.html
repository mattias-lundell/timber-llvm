<h3>EchoServer2</h3>
<p>
This is a minor extension of <tt>EchoServer</tt>: when started, it
expects an integer command line argument <tt>maxClients</tt>, denoting
the maximal number of concurrently served clients. If more clients
connect, they are just informed that the server is busy and
disconnected.

<hr>
The differences to <tt>EchoServer</tt> are the following:
<p>
  We need to keep track of the number of served clients.
  For this we use a <a href="Counter_descr.html"><tt>Counter</tt></a>
  object, created by the root object.
  <p> When a new client connects, the counter value is retrieved and
  only if this value is small enough is an <tt>echo</tt> action installed;
  otherwise the client is informed that the server is busy and the
  socket closed.  When a client closes the connection, the counter is decreased.
  <p>
  A <tt>Counter</tt> object is appropriate here, since several server objects,
  each interacting with one client, interacts with it. In
  contrast, the line number local to each server object is maintained
  in a simple integer state variable.
