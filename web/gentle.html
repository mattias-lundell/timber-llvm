<h3>A gentle introduction</h3>
<p>
The overall purpose of a Timber program is to <em>react to events</em> sent to it from 
its execution environment. This process is potentially infinite, and the order of external 
events is also not generally known in advance.
<p>
To capture this intuition, Timber defines its primary run-time structure to be a set of 
interconnected <em>reactive objects</em>, that each encapsulate a piece of the global 
program state. A reactive object is a passive entity defined by a set of methods, whose 
relative execution order is left to be determined by clocks and external events. Between 
invocations, a Timber object just maintains its state, ready to react when a method call 
occurs. Like real-world objects, Timber objects evolve in parallel, although the methods 
belonging to a particular object are always run under mutually exclusion. Concurrency as 
well as state protection is thus implicit in Timber, and does not require any direct 
mentioning of threads or other concurrency constructs.
<p>
Objects are created by instantiating a <em>class</em>. Methods are either <em>asynchronous</em>
or <em>synchronous</em>, as denoted by the keywords <strong>action</strong> and 
<strong>request</strong>, respectively. The most radical property of Timber is that it is 
free from any indefinitely blocking constructs; because of this, a Timber object is always 
fully responsive when not actively executing code. This process structure should be 
contrasted to the common infinite event-loop pattern in other languages, where blocking 
system calls are used to partition an otherwise linear thread of execution into event-handling 
fragments.
<p>
Each reaction in Timber is furthermore associated with a programmable <em>timing window</em>,
delimited by upper and lower constraints called the <em>baseline</em> and the <em>deadline</em>
of a reaction. The semantics of these constraints is formally defined like the rest of the 
language, and serves the purpose of codifying the legal behavior of a Timber system in a 
platform-independent manner. The timing window is inherited by each method call by default, 
but can also be manually set by the programmer; using the constructs <strong>after</strong> for 
moving a window forward with an offset, and <strong>before</strong> for setting a timing window 
width. Both values are measured relative to the fixed reference-points of baselines, never 
from the point in time a method call is actually made. Posting a message to arrive at some 
specific time into the future is thus easy in Timber, and defining a periodic process amounts 
to the special case of repeating such a pattern recursively.
<p>
The following Timber example shows a simple implementation of a <em>sonar driver</em> that 
is coupled to an alarm.  The specifications assumed state that a sonar beep should be 2 
milliseconds long, with a maximum jitter of 50 microseconds, and that the required accuracy 
of the measurements dictate that time-stamps associated with beeps must also be accurate 
down to the 50 microsecond range. The figure below illustrates the timing windows 
constraining the involved methods <tt>ping</tt> and stop, and thus, indirectly, the actual 
beep produced.
<p><img src="Beep.png" alt="" width="600" height="200" /></p>
<p>
Furthermore, the sonar is supposed to sound every 3 seconds, and the deadline for reacting 
to off-limit measurements is 5 milliseconds. These specifications look as  follows when 
translated into Timber code:
<pre> 
sonar port alarm critical =
   <strong>class</strong>
      tm = <strong>new</strong> timer
      count := 0
      ping = <strong>before</strong> (microsec 50) <strong>action</strong>
                port.write beep_on
                tm.reset
                <strong>after</strong> (millisec 2) stop
                <strong>after</strong> (sec 3) ping
      stop = <strong>before</strong> (microsec 50) <strong>action</strong>
                port.write beep_off
      echo = <strong>before</strong> (millisec 5) <strong>action</strong>
                diff &lt;- tm.sample
                <strong>if</strong> critical diff <strong>then</strong>
                    count := count + 1
                    alarm count
      <strong>result</strong> { interrupt = echo, start = ping }

</pre>
<p>The header <tt>sonar port alarm critical</tt> here defines function <tt>sonar</tt> to take 
<tt>port</tt> (the port controlling the beeping hardware), <tt>alarm</tt> (the method to call 
in emergency) and <tt>critical</tt> (a boolean function on time values) as parameters. The 
shown class construct creates a local <tt>timer</tt> object instance <tt>tm</tt>, initializes 
a state variable <tt>count</tt> to 0, and furthermore defines the asynchronous methods 
<tt>ping</tt>, <tt>stop</tt> and <tt>echo</tt>. The resulting interface is a record 
containing methods named <tt>interrupt</tt> and <tt>start</tt>, which are just exported 
aliases for the local method names <tt>echo</tt> and <tt>ping</tt>, respectively.
<p>
A <tt>timer</tt> object allows the time between the current baseline and the baseline of 
the last timer reset to be measured. This is utilized in method <tt>echo</tt>, where the 
time since the last invocation of <tt>ping</tt> (bound to differ from the beep emission by 
at most 50 microseconds) is sampled and analyzed to determine if an alarm should be sent. 
When this happens, the provided alarm method is given the accumulated alarm count as an 
argument. Notice how each <tt>ping</tt> causes two future events to be triggered: one call 
to <tt>stop</tt> 2 milliseconds from the current baseline, and a recursive invocation of 
<tt>ping</tt> itself after 3 seconds to keep the periodic sonar activity alive.
<p>
As an example of how a sonar object might be instantiated to run on a bare-metal embedded 
system, here follows an example of the <tt>root</tt> declaration for such a system.
<pre>root regs = <strong>class</strong>
    crit d = d < millisec 15
    a = <strong>new</strong> alarm (regs!com_port_addr)
    s = <strong>new</strong> sonar (regs!sonar_port_addr) a crit
    <strong>result</strong> [ s.start, s.interrupt, a.ack ]
</pre>
<p>
On this level, the interface to the software (as seen from the hardware) is the list 
of interrupt handlers it provides (enclosed in square brackets).  Consequently (from the 
software perspective), the hardware takes the shape of an array of device registers that 
can be read or written (with ! being the indexing operator). The parametric class 
<tt>root</tt> above is thus of a type that can be instantiated and used directly by the 
run-time system of a typical bare-metal platform, although it should be noted that the 
exact shape of a root definition can vary between Timber platforms -- under the POSIX 
environment, for example, the root class returns just a startup procedure, while taking 
a full-featured operating system interface as an argument.
<p>
The semantics of Timber allows a natural implementation in terms of an EDF scheduler, 
where the asynchronous methods of a program correspond to tasks, objects take the role 
of shared resources, and all methods (synchronous as well as asynchronous) simply denote 
code sequences that require exclusive access to the owning object. Timber also relegates 
management of its garbage-collected heap to idle time, thus facilitating direct 
application of known schedulability and execution time analysis methods. The implementation 
technique used furthermore allows both objects and messages to be created in large numbers 
without incurring any run-time penalty, at the same time as the number of threads behind 
the scenes (i.e., the number of execution contexts and stacks) can be limited to the 
maximum preemption depth a system is expected to need.
<p>
Additional features of Timber not covered here include a strong static type system 
supporting subtyping, parametric polymorphism with overloading, and automatic type inference; 
a rich set of heap-allocated immutable datatypes; first-class citizenship to all values 
(meaning that methods as well as classes can be sent as arguments and stored inside data 
structures); and a referentially transparent evaluation semantics in the purely functional
tradition.
