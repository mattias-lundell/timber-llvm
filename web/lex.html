<h3>Lexical structure</h3>
<h4>Comments</h4>
<p>
A Timber program may contain two kinds of comments:
<ul>
  <li>A line comment starts with the lexeme <tt>--</tt> and extends to the next newline.
</li>
  <li>A general comment starts with <tt>{-</tt> and extends to the first matching
<tt>-}</tt>. This allows for nested general comments; a closing <tt>-}</tt> matches only
one opening <tt>{-</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Names</h4>
<p>
A Timber program consists mainly of definitions that give meaning to names. There are six
separate namespaces in Timber:
<ul>
  <li> <em>variables</em>, <em>selectors</em> and <em>constructors</em>, which all denote
  different kinds of values.
  </li>
  <li> <em>type constructors</em> and <em>type variables</em>, which denote types.</li>
  <li><em>module names</em>, which refer to modules.
</ul>
<p>
Names are <em>simple</em> or <em>qualified</em>; the latter are used to disambiguate names defined in different modules.
<h4>Simple names</h4>
<p>
Simple names come in two lexically distinct forms, <em>identifiers</em> and <em>operators</em>.
<p>
An identifier consists of a letter followed by zero or more letters, digits, single quotes and underscores.
The initial letter must be upper case for constructors, type constructors and
module names, and must be lower case for variables, selectors and type variables. The following lexically correct
identifiers are keywords of the language and may not be used as names:
<pre>
<b>
action    after     before    case      class
data      do        default   else      elsif
forall    if        import    in        instance  
let       module    new       of        private
request   result    struct    then      type      
typeclass use       where       
</b>
</pre> 
<p> An operator is a sequence of one or more <em>symbol characters</em>.
The symbol characters are defined by enumeration: <tt>:!#$%&*+\<=>?@\^|-~</tt>.
An operator starting with <tt>:</tt> is a constructor; otherwise it is a variable. Only
variables and constructors have operator forms; the other four namespaces contain only
identifiers. The following lexically correct operators are keywords and may not be used
as names:
<pre>
.    ..   ::   :=   =    \    \\   |    <-   ->   --
</pre>
<p>
An identifier may be used as an operator by enclosing it in backquotes; <tt>`elem`</tt> is an operator.
Conversely, an operator may be used as an identifier by enclosing it in parentheses; <tt>(+)</tt> is an identifier.

<p> Examples:
<table align=center><TR>
  <TH>Names
</TH> 
<TH> Possible namespaces
</TH>
</TR>
<TR><TD><tt>Color, T3, T_3, T_3'</tt></TD><TD> constructors, type constructors, module names</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><tt>x, env, myTable, a', x_1</tt></TD><TD>variables, selectors, type variables</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><tt>+, #=#, @@</tt></TD><TD>variables</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><tt>:, :++:</tt></TD><TD>constructors</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><tt>#3</tt></TD><TD>ILLEGAL; mixture of operator and identifier symbols.</TD></TR>
</table>
<h4>Precedence and associativity</h4>
<p>
The precedence and associativity of operators are determined by their syntax. The operators in the following table
are listed in decreasing precedence, i.e. an operator that appears in a later row binds less tightly. Function application,
denoted by juxtaposition, binds tighter than all operators.

<table align=center><TR>
  <TH>Operators
</TH> 
<TH> Associativity
</TH>
</TR>
<TR><TD><tt>@</tt></TD><TD align=center>Right</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><tt>^</tt></TD><TD align=center>Right</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><tt>* / `div` `mod`</tt></TD><TD align=center>Left</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><tt>+ -</tt></TD><TD align=center>Left</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><tt>: ++</tt></TD><TD align=center>Right</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><tt>== /= < > <= >=</tt></TD><TD align=center>None</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><tt>&&</tt></TD><TD align=center>Right</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><tt>||</tt></TD><TD align=center>Right</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><tt> >> >>=</tt></TD><TD align=center>Left</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><tt>$</tt></TD><TD align=center>Right</TD></TR>
</table>
For an operator that is not listed in the above table, the precedence is determined by
first deleting all characters except <tt>+-*/<></tt>. If what remains is
<ul>
  <li> a non-empty
sequence of <tt>+</tt> and <tt>-</tt> characters, the associativity and precedence of the operator are the same as
those of <tt>+</tt> and <tt>-</tt>.</li>
  <li> a non-empty sequence of <tt>*</tt> and <tt>/</tt> characters, the associativity and precedence of the operator are the same as
those of <tt>*</tt> and <tt>/</tt>.</li>
  <li> a non-empty sequence <tt><</tt> and <tt>></tt> characters, the associativity and precedence of the operator are the same as
those of <tt><</tt> and <tt>></tt>.</li>
  <li> something else, the associativity and precedence of the operator are the same as those of <tt>@</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The operators in the table above are defined in the Prelude, but can be redefined in user modules, except for the following
three exceptions:
<ul>
<li> <tt>:</tt> is the list construction operator and is supported by special syntax;
the notation <tt> [a, b, c]</tt> is syntactic sugar for the list <tt>a : b : c : []</tt>.
  <p>
  In harmony with this, the empty list has the (lexically illegal) name <tt>[]</tt>.
<li> The operators <tt>&&</tt> and <tt>||</tt>, denoting logical and and or, respectively, are predefined in the language
and are non-strict in their right operand.
<p>
  This means that, if evaluation of <em>a</em> in
<em>a</em> <tt>&&</tt> <em>b</em> gives <tt>False</tt> as result, the result of the complete expression is <tt>False</tt> and
<em>b</em> is
not evaluated (and, in particular, a runtime error or non-termination that would occur during evaluation of <em>b</em> is avoided).
<p>
Similarly, if the left operand to <tt>||</tt> evaluates to <tt>True</tt>, the result of the complete expression is
<tt>True</tt> without evaluating the right operand.
<p>
Thus, semantically speaking, <tt>&&</tt> and <tt>||</tt> are not operators at all but special expression-forming constructs. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Qualified names</h4>
<p>
Timber modules are used to manage namespaces. In this mechanism, simple names are extended to qualified forms, where the
simple name is prefixed by the name of the module where it is defined. To allow several modules with the same name in a system,
module names themselves may be qualified.
<p> A <em>qualified module name</em> is a sequence of simple module names interspersed with periods, such as
<tt>Data.Functional.List</tt>. The module name (given in the module header) is here just <tt>List</tt>, but the full name must be used by
importing clients and is also used by the Timber installation to store and retrieve modules in the file system. Exactly how this is done is
installation-dependent.
<p>
Imagine a module <tt>Dictionary</tt>, which defines among others the names <tt>insert</tt> and <tt>|-></tt>. An importing module may
refer to these names using the qualified forms <tt>Dictionary.insert</tt> and <tt>Dictionary.|-></tt> in order to avoid possible name conflicts. See the modules page for more information on import and use of other modules.The simple name that is the suffix of a qualified name decides if the
name is an operator or an identifier and if it is a constructor or not.
<p>
A qualified name may not be used at a defining occurrence, only when a name is used. (The module prefix is uniquely determined by
the module name, hence superfluous in the definition.)
